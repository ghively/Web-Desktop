feat: Implement interactive terminal and enhance web desktop features

This commit introduces significant improvements and new features to the web desktop,
focusing on enhanced user interaction and preparatory steps for future roadmap items.

Key changes include:
- **Interactive Terminal:** Implemented a fully functional interactive terminal
  using `xterm.js` on the frontend and `node-pty` on the backend, communicating
  via WebSockets. This provides a native-like terminal experience.
- **Dynamic Running Apps (Legacy Frontend):** The top bar in the legacy frontend
  (`frontend-simple`) now dynamically displays running applications, allowing
  for quick window switching.
- **Application Launcher Improvements (Legacy Frontend):** The app launcher
  in `frontend-simple` has been updated for better reliability in displaying
  installed applications.
- **Nginx Proxy Manager & Home Assistant Research:** Conducted initial research into
  integrating Nginx Proxy Manager and Home Assistant, with example code and
  configuration instructions provided.
- **Feature Roadmap:** Created a detailed `ROADMAP.md` document outlining future
  development plans and research findings.
- **Backend Stability:** Addressed `ts-node` path issues and removed duplicate
  imports in the backend server.
- **Frontend Build Fixes:** Corrected PostCSS configuration in the frontend
  (`frontend`) to address build errors.
- **Saved Simple Terminal:** The previous simple command-line terminal
  implementation has been saved to `frontend-simple/js/simple-terminal.js` as
  per user request for potential future AI chatbot integration.
